The _Profund Task Panel_ will be a replacement for the current _Profund Contract Connector_ Word Add-In. The _Profund Task Panel_ will target Microsoft Office 2013 and later. Users of earlier versions of MS Office will want to stick with the _Profund Contract Connector_ Add-In.

**PHASE 2: Provide fully integrated reporting options in MS Excel**

_In MS Excel the Profund Task Panel will give users the ability to:_
- Review and manipulate financial data from the Profund database for custom reporting (central office adminstrators only)
- Import Employee history, demographic information, and staff data from the Profund database for quick analysis
